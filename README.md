# Election-Analysis

##Overview

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to create a program that would review a spreadsheet listing individual votes, the county in which the vote was made, and the person for whom the vote was cast. The goal of the program is to iterate through each line in the spreadsheet and identify: 1) vote totals by candidate, 2) vote percentages by candidate, 3) vote totals by county, and 4) vote percentages by county. The program can be run in Terminal/GitBash to find these figures, but it will also print the results to a .txt file.
